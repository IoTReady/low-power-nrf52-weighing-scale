This driver gives an abstraction layer for multiple e-paper displays. But,
functionalities provided by this driver will be limited to print text, and 
rectangles.

1. Number of lines calculations. 
Number of pixels per line = (Height of selected font +
                                    Before each line 4 empty pixels)

Max number of lines = (total pixels / no of pixels per line)

2. Number of characters in line = (total pixel / Width of selected font).
