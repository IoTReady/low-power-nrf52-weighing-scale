Here one can find all the Hardware design files.
We tried 3 different designs for the weighing scale project and settled with the "HX711" based design as our final.
So you will find the final design explained on the main page.
The other two designs of "LPV821" and "LTC6915" based weighing scales are also fully functional, one may have to play around with the adc functions in the firmware though.
